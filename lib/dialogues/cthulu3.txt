0: The Great Old One reveals itself before you at last! You are filled with respect from the other eldritch beasts, their energy and recognition still resonating off of you. It is only natural you have finally garnered its attention.
0: Initially, you do not think it is pleased with you. You do not mind this: you have awoken it by bringing about an unbalance in the arcane, and roused it from its slumber. This, you realise, is a key to what you desire.
0: You do not want to harm anyone. You do not want despair to befall all, even the most eldritch of beasts. You know, you begin to prompt, it does not have to be like this.
0: It knows everything. What would the Great Old One not know, after all? But that conviction of yours is unwavering. It begins to dream for the first time, of peace, of tranquillity, among other otherworldly beasts of its kind. 
0: It closes its eye. It agrees to your proposition of peace.
